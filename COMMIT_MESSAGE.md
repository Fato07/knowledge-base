## Main Commit Message:
feat: Add KB Daemon intelligent capture system with Basic Memory integration

## Detailed Description:
### Added KB Daemon System (.kb-daemon/)
- Intelligent development activity capture (git, shell, file changes)
- Automated categorization and importance scoring
- Daily review interface for converting events to knowledge entries
- Integration with Basic Memory graph database
- Manual control (no auto-start) for privacy

### Key Features Implemented:
- `kb start/stop` - Manual daemon control
- `kb status` - Show daemon status and statistics  
- `kb review` - Daily review interface
- `kb full` - Complete sync (review + graph update)
- Git hooks for automatic commit/branch tracking
- Shell monitoring for development commands
- SQLite database for event storage
- Markdown generation for knowledge entries

### Fixed Issues:
- Removed VS Code terminal auto-start errors
- Fixed path issues (now uses project directory)
- Implemented missing status command
- Added full sync command for Basic Memory integration

### Project Structure:
- .kb-daemon/capture/ - Event capture modules
- .kb-daemon/process/ - Event processing and categorization
- .kb-daemon/storage/ - Database management
- .kb-daemon/interface/ - CLI review interface
- .kb-daemon/config/ - Configuration files

### Privacy & Security:
- All sensitive data excluded from git (.gitignore configured)
- Manual control - no automatic startup
- Local storage only - no cloud dependencies
- Database and logs excluded from version control

### Integration:
- Works alongside Basic Memory for graph queries
- Generates markdown files compatible with Obsidian
- VS Code tasks for quick access to commands
