# Knowledge Base

This is your personal knowledge graph managed by Basic Memory.

## Structure

- **projects/** - Active projects and their details
- **learning/** - Technologies, concepts, and learning notes
- **tools/** - Development tools, configurations, and setups
- **people/** - Collaborators, contacts, and team members
- **architecture/** - System designs, patterns, and decisions
- **daily/** - Daily logs and journal entries

## How to Use

1. **Natural Conversation**: Just talk to Claude normally and ask it to "create a note about X"
2. **Automatic Linking**: Claude will create relations between related concepts
3. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Ask "What do I know about X?" to retrieve information
4. **Context Building**: Claude can traverse the graph to understand complex topics
