# Solitude Architecture Deep Dive

## Observations

### System Architecture Patterns
- [pattern] Microservices architecture with Go backend services
- [pattern] Event-driven workflow orchestration using Temporal
- [pattern] Multi-database strategy for different data types
- [pattern] Cloud-native deployment on Google Cloud Run
- [pattern] SSO and directory sync for enterprise customers

### Database Design Philosophy
- [design] PostgreSQL for transactional business data (40+ tables)
- [design] MongoDB for flexible document metadata
- [design] Memgraph for agent memory graphs (relationships and context)
- [design] Weaviate for vector embeddings (semantic search, similarity)
- [rationale] Each database optimized for specific data access patterns

### Key Technical Decisions
- [decision] Go chosen for backend - performance, concurrency, cloud-native
- [decision] Temporal for workflows - reliability, visibility, versioning
- [decision] WorkOS for auth - enterprise SSO support out of the box
- [decision] React Remix for frontend - SSR, better SEO, faster loads
- [decision] Infisical for secrets - customer isolation, compliance

### Security Architecture
- [layer] API Gateway with JWT authentication
- [layer] Role-based access control at resource level
- [layer] Separate customer secrets management (Infisical)
- [layer] Infrastructure secrets in GCP Secret Manager
- [layer] Row-level security in PostgreSQL

### Scalability Considerations
- [scaling] Stateless backend services for horizontal scaling
- [scaling] Temporal workflows for distributed task processing
- [scaling] GPU cluster management for AI workloads
- [scaling] Multi-region support planned (AWS, Fly.io)
- [scaling] Event-driven architecture for decoupling

### Data Flow Patterns
- [flow] User → API Gateway → Backend Service → Database
- [flow] Workflow trigger → Temporal → Activity Workers → AI Agents
- [flow] File upload → GCS Bucket → File Registry → Job Association
- [flow] AI Agent → Memory Graph → Vector Embeddings → Similarity Search

### Integration Points
- [integration] WorkOS for SSO and directory sync
- [integration] Stripe for billing and subscriptions
- [integration] Resend for transactional emails
- [integration] Honeycomb for distributed tracing
- [integration] Google Cloud Storage for file management

### Development Workflow
- [workflow] Feature branches → Pull requests → Code review
- [workflow] Merge to staging → Auto-deploy to staging environment
- [workflow] Testing in staging → Merge to main → Production deploy
- [workflow] Local development with docker-compose
- [workflow] Test data generation for local testing

## Relations

- implements [[Microservices Architecture]]
- uses [[Temporal Workflows]]
- secures_with [[JWT Authentication]]
- stores_in [[Multi-Database Strategy]]
- scales_with [[Horizontal Scaling]]
- monitors_with [[Distributed Tracing]]
- deploys_to [[Cloud Run]]

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [debt] Need to implement caching layer (Redis)
- [debt] Database connection pooling optimization needed
- [debt] Frontend bundle size optimization required
- [improvement] Add circuit breakers for external services
- [improvement] Implement rate limiting at API gateway
- [improvement] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [improvement] Enhance observability with custom metrics

## Performance Targets

- [target] API response time < 200ms p95
- [target] Workflow execution < 5s for standard tasks
- [target] Database query time < 50ms p99
- [target] File upload/download > 10MB/s
- [target] 99.9% uptime SLA

## Disaster Recovery

- [backup] Daily automated database backups
- [backup] Cross-region backup replication
- [recovery] RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 1 hour
- [recovery] RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour
- [procedure] Documented runbooks for common incidents
