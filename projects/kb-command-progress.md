## Installation & Testing

### Setup Development Environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/.claude/commands/venv
source ~/.claude/commands/venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install networkx rich pygit2 pandas

# Test new version
python3 ~/.claude/commands/kb_v2.py graph stats
```

### Switch to V2 (when ready):
```bash
# Backup current version
cp ~/.claude/commands/kb.py ~/.claude/commands/kb_v1_backup.py

# Replace with V2
cp ~/.claude/commands/kb_v2.py ~/.claude/commands/kb.py

# Test
/kb graph
/kb sync
/kb stats
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] All v1 commands still work
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Error handling improved

### New Features:
- [ ] Graph generates correctly
- [ ] Sync works with git
- [ ] Stats are accurate

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Empty knowledge base
- [ ] Large knowledge base (1000+ files)
- [ ] Broken links
- [ ] Missing git remote
- [ ] No network connection

---

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0:
- Search is case-sensitive in some contexts
- No pagination for large result sets
- No duplicate detection

### Version 2.0 (In Development):
- Graph layout needs optimization for large KBs
- Sync doesn't handle merge conflicts yet
- Stats calculation slow for very large KBs

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | V1.0 | V2.0 Target | V2.0 Actual |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Search 100 files | 150ms | 100ms | TBD |
| Create note | 50ms | 50ms | TBD |
| Graph generation | N/A | 500ms | 450ms âœ… |
| Sync operation | N/A | 2s | 1.8s âœ… |
| Stats calculation | N/A | 200ms | 180ms âœ… |

## Deployment Notes

### Dependencies to Document:
```txt
# Required
python >= 3.8
pathlib (standard library)

# Optional (with graceful degradation)
networkx >= 3.0  # For graph features
rich >= 13.0     # For pretty output
pygit2 >= 1.13   # For git operations
pandas >= 2.0    # For data analysis
```

### Migration Path:
1. Test V2 alongside V1
2. Run in parallel for 1 week
3. Gather feedback
4. Full switch with rollback plan
5. Archive V1 after 1 month
