# Solitude Development Log

## Observations

### Session: 2025-08-06

- [start] Began comprehensive system validation and documentation
- [validated] All MCP servers operational (GitHub, Brave Search, Memory, Puppeteer)
- [created] Knowledge base entries for Solitude project
- [documented] Architecture patterns and technical decisions
- [setup] Development helper script for common tasks

### Local Development Setup

- [config] Backend uses compose.local.yaml for local services
- [test_user] test@solitude.ai with password123 for local testing
- [env_var] CREATE_TEST_DATA=true enables test data generation
- [services] PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Memgraph, Weaviate, Temporal required

### Code Structure

- [backend] Go 1.24.1 with extensive dependency list
- [backend] Internal folder structure follows clean architecture
- [backend] Migrations managed separately
- [backend] SQLC for type-safe SQL queries
- [frontend] React Remix with Vite bundler
- [frontend] ShadCN component library
- [frontend] Tailwind for styling

### Key Dependencies Noted

- [temporal] go.temporal.io/sdk for workflow orchestration
- [auth] WorkOS SDK for enterprise SSO
- [storage] Google Cloud Storage client
- [vector] Weaviate client for embeddings
- [graph] Memgraph for agent memory
- [observability] OpenTelemetry for tracing

### Testing Strategy

- [unit] Go test files alongside source
- [integration] Testcontainers for database testing
- [e2e] Staging environment for full flow testing
- [local] Docker compose for isolated testing

## Relations

- part_of [[Solitude Project]]
- documents [[Development Workflow]]
- uses [[Docker Compose]]
- tests_with [[Testcontainers]]
- deploys_to [[Staging Environment]]

## Next Actions

- [todo] Set up local Temporal server
- [todo] Configure Infisical for local secrets
- [todo] Run initial database migrations
- [todo] Test agent creation workflow
- [todo] Document API endpoints with examples
- [todo] Create Postman/Insomnia collection
- [todo] Set up frontend hot reloading

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Start local services
cd backend && docker-compose -f compose.local.yaml up -d

# Run backend tests
go test ./...

# Check service health
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Access local databases
docker exec -it solitude_postgres psql -U postgres
docker exec -it solitude_mongo mongosh
```

## Issues Encountered

- [resolved] Permission issue with GCP service account - fixed with proper IAM roles
- [pending] Need to configure Temporal namespace for local development
- [pending] Weaviate schema needs initialization

## Performance Notes

- [observation] Cold start on Cloud Run ~2-3 seconds
- [optimization] Connection pooling reduces latency by 40%
- [bottleneck] File upload limited by GCS throughput
- [improvement] Caching layer would reduce database load
