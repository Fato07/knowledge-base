# Knowledge Graph Connections

## Observations

- [insight] Knowledge graph analysis shows 5 clusters with sparse connections
- [main_hub] claude-code-setup is the central hub with 18 connections
- [connected] Main cluster includes [[Basic Memory]], [[MCP Servers]], [[Obsidian]], [[Node.js]], [[Development Environment]]
- [gap] Most clusters only have 1-2 nodes indicating isolation
- [opportunity] Need more cross-references between topics for better knowledge retrieval

## Key Relationships to Strengthen

### Development Projects
- [[Solitude Project]] should connect to:
  - [[Go Backend]] - primary language
  - [[React Remix Frontend]] - UI framework
  - [[Temporal Workflows]] - orchestration
  - [[PostgreSQL]] - main database
  - [[Docker Compose]] - local development
  - [[Claude Code Setup]] - development environment

### Architecture Patterns
- [[Solitude Architecture]] should link to:
  - [[Microservices Architecture]] - design pattern
  - [[Multi-Database Strategy]] - data layer
  - [[JWT Authentication]] - security
  - [[Distributed Tracing]] - observability
  - [[Cloud Run]] - deployment target

### Tools and Configuration
- [[Claude Code Setup]] already connects well but add:
  - [[Solitude Project]] - active project
  - [[KB Command Enhancement]] - tooling
  - [[Git Repository]] - version control
  - [[Terminal Configuration]] - shell setup

### Knowledge Management
- [[Basic Memory]] should connect to:
  - [[Knowledge Graph Connections]] - this note
  - [[Obsidian]] - visualization tool
  - [[Markdown]] - file format
  - [[Git Repository]] - backup strategy

## Strategies for Better Connections

### 1. Bidirectional Linking
- [strategy] When creating note A that mentions B, also update B to reference A
- [benefit] Creates stronger graph with multiple paths between concepts

### 2. Hub Notes
- [strategy] Create index notes that link to related topics
- [example] "Development Tools Index" linking all tool configurations
- [example] "Project Index" linking all projects

### 3. Tag-Based Connections
- [strategy] Use consistent tags to group related content
- [tags] #architecture, #tools, #projects, #learning

### 4. Daily Logs as Connectors
- [strategy] Daily logs naturally link multiple topics worked on
- [benefit] Creates temporal connections between concepts

## Relations

- improves [[Basic Memory]]
- enhances [[Claude Code Setup]]
- documents [[Knowledge Base Enhancement]]
- visualized_by [[Obsidian]]

## Action Items

- [todo] Update Solitude notes with architecture links
- [todo] Create hub notes for major categories
- [todo] Add bidirectional links to existing notes
- [todo] Run graph analysis weekly to track improvement
